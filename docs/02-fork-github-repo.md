# 2. Fork the GitHub repository

GitHub will host your map for free and store any photos you upload. This step
takes about 5 minutes.

## 2.1 Create a GitHub account

If you don't already have one, sign up at <https://github.com/signup>. The
free plan is fine.

> 💡 Pick a username that suits your park or Friends group — it'll
> appear in your map's web address (e.g.
> `lillie-park.github.io/…`) unless you later set up your own domain
> name.

## 2.2 Fork this repository

On the park-treemap repository page, click the **Fork** button (top right).
GitHub will copy the project to your own account.

You can name the fork whatever you like, e.g. `my-park-trees`. For the
**Description**, something like *"A map of the trees in Lillie Park,
London"* works well. Leave the *"Copy the main branch only"* checkbox
**ticked**, and keep the repository **Public**.

Click **Create fork**.

## 2.3 Turn on GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is the free hosting service that serves your map.

In your forked repository, click:

```
Settings → Pages
```

Under **Build and deployment**:

- **Source**: *Deploy from a branch*
- **Branch**: `main` and `/ (root)`

Click **Save**.

Within a minute or two, the *Pages* page will show your live URL — something
like `https://your-username.github.io/my-park-trees/`. **You may need to
refresh the page in your browser before the URL appears.** Open it. You
should see the welcome screen — the configuration isn't filled in yet, so
it can't load any data, but that's expected. We'll fix that in step 4.

<!-- TODO: add a screenshot of the Pages page showing the live URL banner -->


## 2.4 Note your repository name

Make a note of the **owner/repo** pair, e.g. `your-username/my-park-trees`.
You'll need it twice: once in step 3 (as a Script Property), once in step 4
(in `config.js`).
